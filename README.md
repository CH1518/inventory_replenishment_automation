# inventory_replenishment_automation
A simple script that queries DQL database with inventory location stocked with consumable items. The script saves the current inventory and will check it with a new inventory instance queried every 30 min. The script will be set to run every 30 min via Window's task manager. If any item in stock is low (per threshold set in the code) it will trigger an email to be sent to the inventory procurement team to replenish. This eliminates human intervention to manually check inventory and create work orders when inventory is low.
